# RFM-Project-Python-

An end-to-end customer segmentation project using RFM analysis to identify high-value and at-risk customers from transactional and master data.

### 📌 Overview

Understanding customer behavior is critical for businesses to improve retention and optimize marketing efforts.
In this project,I have combined customer transactional data with customer master data and performed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, enabling meaningful customer segmentation and actionable business insights.

### ❓ Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to identify which customers are most valuable, loyal, or at risk.The objective of this project is to segment customers based on purchasing behavior using RFM analysis, helping businesses design targeted marketing and retention strategies.

### 📂 Dataset Overview 

The project uses two relational datasets:
- Customer Master Data: Contains customer profile information such as demographics and customer ID.
- Customer Transactions Data: Contains transaction-level details including transaction date and transaction amount.
- These datasets are linked using a CustomerID

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

- Programming Language: Python

- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Environment: Jupyter Notebook

### 🔍 Approach

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Feature engineering inorder to calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
- Rule-based RFM scoring.
- Customer segmentation into behavioral groups.
- Visualization and interpretation of results.

### 📈 Insights

- A small group of customers buy a lot and bring in most of the money for the business.
- Some customers already trust the business, so it’s easy to show them new products or better offer.
- Some customers haven’t bought anything in a long time, so the business should remind them or give them offers to bring them back.

### ✅ Results

This project shows how RFM analysis can turn raw transaction data into clear customer groups. The insights help businesses understand their customers better, focus on retention, plan targeted marketing, and ultimately improve revenue, making the analysis useful for real-world business decisions.
